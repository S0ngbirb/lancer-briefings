The Great Acheron, an inventor/scientist who focused mainly upon human augmentation, created fourteen combat androids. It was to be his life's work to create the greatest combat android the universe had ever known, but he managed it in but a fortnight. The fourteenth iteration, Xi, not only met his predictions of "the best battle android", but shattered them outright. 

Xi was thoroughly skilled in on-foot, hand-to-hand combat. He was able to catch bullets in the air, break swords with his fists, and when given a blade himself, could cut an object into countless minute pieces in a matter of seconds. Proud of his creation, Acheron gave him a name beyond just his number: Lethe, and sent the bot out into the world to "find the strongest thing out there and cleave it in twain". The scientist later went missing. Some say he was recruited to a top-secret subterranean testing facility, others said he simply found himself content, his life work being fulfilled, and spent the last of his days in Florida (a theory lacking in credibility due to his abhorrent distaste for Floridians).

Lethe, however, never got to fulfill his orders, as mere days after getting turned loose he was embroiled in trouble after letting his feelings (which Acheron had attested were identical to a human's, much like Lethe's appearance) run amok upon meeting a woman who, oblivious to him, was the daughter of the head of the single largest criminal organisation in the world (at the time).

During a mission at sea for said criminal organisation, Lethe fell overboard and sank directly to the bottom. Not because he's heavy- he's actually quite light- but because he didn't know how to swim. After a 12 month descent, Lethe found himself at the searing base of an underwater trench, mere metres away from the molten core of the world. 

It took him 600 years to clamber out of the trench and a back onto dry land, where he found the world he knew gone, replaced with an unrecognisable, yet highly advanced, imposter.

And so he set off unto this new world. In dire need of a towel.

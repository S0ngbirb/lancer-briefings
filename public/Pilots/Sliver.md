Millennia old fiction. Turo stuck around for a long while, but he wasn't fooled that easily.

A "probabilistically promised paradise," they called it. "If the universe is infinite, there really must be a land of milk and honey!"

Every time they stopped, Turo would find something fascinating - something he couldn't take with him. And every time, it was inevitable: they'd declare this wasn't the right place, and he'd have to get back on the ship.

He's tired of it.

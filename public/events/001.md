 The **901st ~~ERROR NO DIVISION NAME FOUND~~** meet on route to the recently-rediscovered planetoid known as **HERCYNIA**
 After a rough landing,and the subsiquent knocking out of JAWS, their Ex-Pilot/MSMC Lawyer, the group heads to the town of Evergreen, with the assistance of **Brava Hadura**

 They are lead to the **Landmark Corporation's** Colony, **Evergreen** and are met by the SIDEWALK-J2 municipal NHP that helps run the colony on **Landmark Corporation's** behalf who goes by the name of **PATIENCE**.

 **PATIENCE** tells the **901st ~~PL<EASE INSERT NAME~~** that **Evergreen** is being plagued by Pirates and Claim jumpers, with one of the main force being a Sniper who has killed 53 people in the span of a few months. **PATIENCE** says that the colonists are calling these pirates "**Egregorians**, based off of an old race of bug like creatures who used simple tools, but were wiped out long before Humanity got to **HERCYNIA**. **PATIENCE** even shows footage of these "**Egregorians**" wearing armor akin to that of a bug which he presumes to be an attempt to fearmonger **Evergreen's** Militia, as well as its townspeople.

 **PATIENCE** requests help with either the Sniper, or with escorting engineers to help fix **Evergreen's** landing pad, after much deliberation, and after stinking up **The Bottom of the Well** (The owner of which is an older man by the name of **Mir Bahadur**) with the smell of burnt starfish deep in their lungs the **901st ~~ERROR~~** chose to go after the Sniper, **VENOM**
